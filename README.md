# Air Qazaq

This is a Next.js project that simulates a fictional airline website for Air Qazaq. The site features a modern design and provides users with information on flight schedules, prices, and availability.

With Next.js, the site is optimized for performance and SEO. It also integrates with APIs and databases to provide real-time data to users.

This project is a great example of how Next.js can be used to create professional-looking websites quickly and easily. Whether you're looking to build a prototype or a fully functional website, Next.js is a great choice.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
